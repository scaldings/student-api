# Student API

This API was made just because I was bored. However, if you find this useful or if you think you can improve it you can either fork it or use it as a dependency.

# Using this as a dependency

**You can use this by simply, adding this to your repositories:**

```xml
	<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
```

__and this to your dependencies:__

```xml
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.scaldings</groupId>
	    <artifactId>student-api</artifactId>
	    <version>-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</dependency>
```

**You can also clone and install it locally:**

```
$	git clone https://github.com/scaldings/student-api.git
$	mvn clean install
```
